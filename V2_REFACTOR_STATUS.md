# V2.0.0 Refactor Status

## Problem Solved
Successfully resolved Go's restriction on defining methods on types from external packages by converting from method-based to function-based API.

### Root Cause
Go doesn't allow package A to define methods on types from package B. Since we split the code into packages:
- Main package: `github.com/netresearch/simple-ldap-go` (contains `LDAP` type)
- Objects package: `github.com/netresearch/simple-ldap-go/objects`

The objects package couldn't add methods like `FindUserByDN()` to the `LDAP` type.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Breaking Change
**Old (v1.x):** Methods on LDAP client
```go
user, err := client.FindUserBySAMAccountName("jdoe")
```

**New (v2.0):** Functions accepting client as parameter
```go
user, err := objects.FindUserBySAMAccountName(client, "jdoe")
```

### 2. Files Refactored
✅ **Completed:**
- `objects/users.go` - Converted to functions with stub implementations
- `objects/groups.go` - Converted to functions with stub implementations
- `objects/computers.go` - Converted to functions with stub implementations
- `MIGRATION.md` - Updated with accurate breaking change documentation
- `README.md` - Updated examples to show new function-based API
- `examples/basic-usage/` - Updated to use new API
- `examples/user-management/` - Updated to use new API

❌ **Disabled (need refactoring):**
- `objects/users_optimized.go.disabled`
- `objects/groups_optimized.go.disabled`
- Most examples that rely on unimplemented methods

## Current State

### What Works
- ✅ Core package builds: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Basic object types defined (User, Group, Computer)
- ✅ Function signatures in place (returning "not implemented" errors)

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Actual LDAP operations (all return "not implemented")
- ❌ Authentication functions not ported
- ❌ Context-based functions not implemented
- ❌ Tests (missing test helper functions)
- ❌ Many examples rely on unimplemented features

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the stub functions** in objects package to actually perform LDAP operations
2. **Create auth package functions** for authentication operations
3. **Add Context variants** for all functions
4. **Fix test infrastructure** to work with new structure
5. **Update remaining examples** or disable until implemented

## Impact Assessment

### Developer Experience
- **Worse**: Less intuitive API (function vs method)
- **Worse**: More verbose (must pass client everywhere)
- **Better**: Clearer package boundaries
- **Better**: Easier to mock/test

### Migration Effort
- **High**: Every LDAP operation call must be updated
- **Breaking**: No backward compatibility possible due to Go restrictions

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

1. **Keep everything in main package** - Avoid splitting, but poor organization
2. **Interface-based approach** - Define interfaces, but adds complexity
3. **Wrapper types** - Embed LDAP in new types, but creates confusion

## Recommendation

This refactor makes the API significantly worse from a usability perspective. Consider:
1. Documenting this as a known limitation of v2.0
2. Potentially maintaining v1.x branch for users who prefer the cleaner API
3. Creating helper functions or a facade pattern to simplify common operations
