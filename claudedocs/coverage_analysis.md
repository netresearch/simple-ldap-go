✅ circuit_breaker.go - Good coverage
✅ interfaces.go - Well tested
✅ concurrency.go - Fixed and tested

## Critical Files Needing Coverage
These files will give us the biggest coverage gains:

### High Priority (Large Files, Low Coverage)
1. **auth.go** - 20% coverage, ~400 lines
2. **users.go** - 15% coverage, ~1000 lines
3. **groups.go** - 15% coverage, ~300 lines
4. **users_optimized.go** - 0% coverage, ~700 lines
5. **groups_optimized.go** - 0% coverage, ~800 lines

### Medium Priority (Moderate Size/Coverage)
6. **pool.go** - 20% coverage, ~500 lines
7. **performance.go** - 30% coverage, ~400 lines
8. **validation.go** - 10% coverage, ~300 lines
9. **errors.go** - 25% coverage, ~250 lines
10. **monitoring.go** - 15% coverage, ~350 lines

### Low Priority (Small or Already Covered)
- mock_ldap.go - Testing infrastructure
- examples/* - Documentation code

## Strategy to Reach 60% Coverage

### Phase 1: Critical Path Coverage (30.5% → 45%)
1. Complete auth.go testing - Add 5%
2. Core users.go operations - Add 5%
3. Core groups.go operations - Add 5%

### Phase 2: Optimized Code Coverage (45% → 60%)
4. users_optimized.go basic paths - Add 7%
5. groups_optimized.go basic paths - Add 8%

### Phase 3: Error & Edge Cases (60% → 80%)
6. Error handling paths - Add 10%
7. Validation logic - Add 5%
8. Pool and performance - Add 5%

## Test Files Created This Session
- auth_comprehensive_test.go (expanded)
- connection_pool_test.go (attempted, removed due to conflicts)
- groups_optimized_test.go (simplified)
- users_optimized_test.go (simplified)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive user operation tests
2. Create comprehensive group operation tests
3. Test optimized code paths with proper mocks
4. Add validation and error path coverage
5. Run full test suite and verify 60%+ achieved

## Blockers & Issues
- API mismatches in optimized files
- Some test files have conflicting type definitions
- Need to properly mock LDAP connections for optimized code
- Circuit breaker tests causing some failures

## Recommendations
- Focus on high-impact files first (users.go, groups.go)
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Mock all external dependencies properly
- Test both success and failure paths
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
